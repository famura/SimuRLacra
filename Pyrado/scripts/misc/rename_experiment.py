"""
Script to copy and rename an experiment. This is not straight-forward since renaming breaks pickling, thus we need
to run this script, instead of simply renaming the experiment folder.
In case you renamed that folder already, reset the name and run this script. The old name can be recovered from the
algorithm's pickle file (usually called algo.pkl)

.. usage::
    python rename_experiment --dir PATH_TO_OLD_EXPERIMENT --new_dir PATH_TO_COPY_NEW_EXPERIMENT_TO
