    Environment wrapper which downsamples the actions coming from the rollout loop.
    This wrapper is intended to be used with the real Quanser devices, since these are set up to usually run on 500Hz,
    i.e. one send and receive every 0.002s. When learning in simulation, this requires a lot of samples per rollout,
    which makes learning more time-consuming and difficult (fine tuning the temporal discount factor). In order to
    be able to learn on a lower frequency, e.g. 100Hz, we downsample the actions passed to the real device, i.e. just
    send every `factor` action.

    .. note::
        The observations are not affected! Thus the policy still receives one observation per environment step,
        i.e. send and receive at the real device's sampling frequency.
