    Re-sampling input data using the nonparametric bootstrap method, computing bootstrap replications using stat_fcn and
    computing a confidence interval on the statistic of interest given by `stat_fcn` which needs to expect the argument
    `axis` (like numpy functions do).

    :param data: data to bootstrap from (for now only 1D arrays supported)
    :param stat_fcn: function to compute a statistic of interest (e.g. mean, variance) on bootstrap samples
    :param num_reps: number of samples in every bootstrap sample
    :param alpha: determines the confidence level $1 - \alpha \in [0, 1]$
    :param ci_sides: one or two-sided confidence interval
    :param axis: axis to compute along in case of 2-dim data
    :param bias_correction: bool to decide if the bias should be subtracted (see [2]). However, the confidence intervals
                            are constructed independent of the bias-correction (see [5, p.7]).
                            The bias-correction can be dangerous in practice. Even though T_bc(D) is less biased than
                            T(D), the bias-corrected estimator may have substantially larger variance. This is due to a
                            possibly higher variability in the estimate of the bias, particularly when computed from
                            small data sets.
                            Other estimates of the bias-correction factor than stat_emp possible, see [4].
    :param studentized: flag to determine if the method based on the t-distribution is used (leads to a wider ci)
    :param seed: value for the random number generators' seeds, pass `None` to skip seeding
    :return: mean of the bootstrap replications, and the confidence interval
