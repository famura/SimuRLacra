    A sampler generates a list of rollouts in some unspecified way.

    Since the sampling might occur in parallel, there is no way to reliably generate an exact amount of samples.
    The sampler can however guarantee a minimum amount of samples to be available. The sampler does not discard any
    samples on it's own, all sampled data will be returned.
    There are two ways to regulate the sampling process:
    1. the minimum number of rollouts
    2. the minimum number of steps in all rollouts

    At least one of these bounds must be specified. If both are set, the sampler will only terminate once both are
    fulfilled.

        force a reinitialization of environment and policy in all subprocesses.

        Note that you don't need to call this if the policy parameters change, since that is to be expected between
        sampling runs, the sample() method takes care of this on it's own.
