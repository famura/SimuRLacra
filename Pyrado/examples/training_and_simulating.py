Have a look at `Pyrado/scripts/training` for more examples.

First, we create an `Experiment`, which basically is a folder (by default in `Pyrado/data/temp`). The experiments are

We can set a seed before creating the modules in oder to be sure that they get initialized identically, every time we
start this script. Note, that sampling with multiple workers is not deterministic, so the result can still vary, but
this then does not depend on the initialization of the networks' weights.

Next, we set up an environment and wrap it as desired.

the environment. Depending on the policy class, there are different parameters to set.

Save the hyper-parameters to a yaml-file is optional, but I highly recommend it, since it facilitates infecting

Finally, we can start training. Here is another option to seed, which becomes more interesting, once we use continue
learning from a saved experiment. See `Pyrado/scripts/continue.py`. In most cases, the training stops after reaching
`max_iter`. We can cancel the procedure any time. Note, that every instance of `Algorithm` saves at every iteration.
However, there are different `snapshot_mode`s, which determine what is saved.
"""
algo.train(seed=1)

"""
After training, we can do to `Pyrado/scripts/simulation` and execute `python sim_policy.py`. Now we can select and
experiment, i.e. environment and policy, to simulate. We can enter a number or a complete path.
