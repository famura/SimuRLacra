The print reveals that we have a 4-dimensional sate space, a 5-dimensional observation space, and a 1-dimensional
action space, all of type `BoxSpace` which is a straightforward continuous space in $R^n$.
Since we are probably here to do some domain randomization, we will start with that.
There are different types of randomizers. The `DomainRandWrapperLive` sets a new set of domain parameters on every
reset of the environment. The `DomainRandWrapperBuffer` maintains a buffer of domain parameter set which we have to
fill explicitly. This way, it cycles through a set of domains. There is also the `MetaDomainRandWrapper` which
adapts the randomizer, i.e. changes the distribution according to which the domain parameters are randomized.

Let's have a look at the randomized simulation. Due to the synchronized random seed we have the same initial state as
well as the same random action. However, the trajectory id not the same since the domains evolve differently.
Note that the very first action and reward are only different for logging.

In general, the environments' individual observation dimensions have very different scales and limits.
It is an open secret that one of the most important things for RL to work well are equally scaled actions and
observations. Thus we will scale these spaces to [-1, 1] for every dimension. Check the wrappers' `_process_act` and
`_process_obs` functions for details. One observation dimension does not have a finite lime. Therefore we need to
provide and explicit limit for normalizing. We can also provide explicit bounds to override existing ones.

In case we want to mask some observations from wer policy, e.g. if the real system does not observe a quantity that is
available during simulation, we can mask them out using the `ObsPartialWrapper`. This wrapper can mask using an array
of zeros and ones, or by passing a list of the exact labels.

We can also apply wrappers that apply additional noise to the action (`GaussianActNoiseWrapper`) or observations
(`GaussianObsNoiseWrapper). The action wrappers will not modify the `action` filed in the recorded rollout, since this
one is capturing the action as they are commanded by the policy.

Real-world devices often have delays. One way to model this effect is by artificially hold back the current action for
a given number of time steps. Again, the modified `action` fields in the recorded rollouts are the same. Have a look at
the printed actions `a_t` as well as next state `s_t+1`

There are also very handy utils to manage chains of wrappers. Examples are`inner_env()` which yields the core
environment, `typed_env()` which yields the first element of the chain equal to the provided type, or `remove_env` which
removes the first element of the chain equal to the provided type.

Finally, **the most important lesson**: the order in which we apply the environment wrappers matters!
For example, applying the `ObsNormWrapper` after the `ObsPartialWrapper` will not give we the intended result (due to
the implementation). Another example is the order of `ObsNormWrapper` and `GaussianObsNoiseWrapper`.
